The General Assembly is the main deliberative assembly of the UN. Composed of all UN member states, the assembly meets in regular yearly sessions, but emergency sessions can also be called. The assembly is led by a president, elected from among the member states on a rotating regional basis, and 21 vice-presidents. The first session convened 10 January 1946 in the Methodist Central Hall in London and included representatives of 51 nations.
<br>
When the General Assembly votes on important questions, a two-thirds majority of those present and voting is required. Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters. All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.
<br>
Draft resolutions can be forwarded to the General Assembly by eight committees
<br>
•General Committee – a supervisory committee consisting of the assembly's president, vice-president, and committee heads
<br>
•Credentials Committee – responsible for determining the credentials of each member nation's UN representatives
<br>
•First Committee (Disarmament and International Security)
<br>
•Second Committee (Economic and Financial)
<br>
•Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural)
<br>
•Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization)
<br>
•Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary)
<br>
•Sixth Committee (Legal)
