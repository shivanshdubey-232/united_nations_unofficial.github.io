		The struggle for peace is an enduring one.
		More than a century ago,in1899,the first International peace Conference was held in
		Hague to elaborate multilateral instruments for settling crises peacefully,preventing
		wars and cidifying rules of warfare.
		<br>
		The permanent court was established in for that which starts working in 1902.
		subsequently,in 1919,the league of nations , conceived during the firsst world war,was established
		under the treaty of Versailles "to promote international coperation and to achieve peace and security".
		But it fails to prevent Second World War.
		<br>
		This lead to rise of "United Nations",the term coined by American president Franklin D Roosevelt
		during the Second World War.
		<br>
		Headquartered in New York,the United Nations officially came into existence on 24 October,1945 with
		the ratifiction of the charter by China, France ,the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom,
		the United states and a majority of other signatories.
		Today there are 196 countries tied with United Nations.

			<u>
				Background
			</u>
		</b>
		-In the century prior to the UN's creation, several international treaty organizations and conferences
		had been formed to regulate conflicts between nations, such as the International Committee of the Red
		Cross and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. Following the catastrophic loss of life in the
		First World War, the Paris Peace Conference established the League of Nations to maintain harmony
		between countries. This organization resolved some territorial disputes and created international
		structures for areas such as postal mail, aviation, and opium control, some of which would later be
		absorbed into the UN. However, the League lacked representation for colonial peoples (then half the
		world's population) and significant participation from several major powers, including the US, USSR,
		Germany, and Japan; it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931,
		the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935, the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, and German
		expansions under Adolf Hitler that culminated in the Second World War.

				1942 "Declaration of United Nations" by the Allies of World War II
			</u>
		</b>
		-Main article: Declaration by United Nations
		The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the US State
		Department in 1939. The text of the "Declaration by United Nations" was drafted by President
		Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins,
		while meeting at the White House, 29 December 1941. It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but left
		no role for France. "Four Policemen" was coined to refer to four major Allied countries, United
		States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China, which emerged in the Declaration by United Nations.
		Roosevelt first coined the term United Nations to describe the Allied countries.
		"On New Year's Day 1942, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, Maxim Litvinov, of the USSR,
		and T. V. Soong, of China, signed a short document which later came to be known as the United Nations
		Declaration and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures.
		The term United Nations was first officially used when 26 governments signed this Declaration. One
		major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which
		Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted. By 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed.
		A JOINT DECLARATION BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN
		IRELAND, THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, COSTA RICA, CUBA,
		CZECHOSLOVAKIA, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, EL SALVADOR, GREECE, GUATEMALA, HAITI, HONDURAS, INDIA,
		LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS, NEW ZEALAND, NICARAGUA, NORWAY, PANAMA, POLAND, SOUTH AFRICA, YUGOSLAVIA
		The Governments signatory hereto,
		Having subscribed to a common program of purposes and principles embodied in the Joint Declaration
		of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain dated
		August 14, 1941, known as the Atlantic Charter,
		Being convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life, liberty,
		independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands
		as well as in other lands, and that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and
		brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world,
		DECLARE:
		1. Each Government pledges itself to employ its full resources, military or economic, against
		those members of the Tripartite Pact and its adherents with which such government is at war.
		2. Each Government pledges itself to cooperate with the Governments signatory hereto
		and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies.
		The foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are, or which may be,
		rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism.
		— The Washington Conference 1941–1942
		During the war, "the United Nations" became the official term for the Allies. To join, countries
		had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the Axis.

		The UN in 1945. In light blue, the founding members. In dark blue, protectorates and territories of
		the founding members.
		The UN was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from the Allied Big Four (the Soviet Union,
		the UK, the US, and China) at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944.After months of planning,
		the UN Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco, 25 April 1945, attended by
		50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the UN Charter.
		"The heads of the delegations of the sponsoring countries took turns as chairman of the plenary
		meetings: Anthony Eden, of Britain, Edward Stettinius, of the United States, T. V. Soong, of China,
		and Vyacheslav Molotov, of the Soviet Union. At the later meetings, Lord Halifax deputized for Mr.
		Eden, Wellington Koo for T. V. Soong, and Mr Gromyko for Mr. Molotov." The UN officially came
		into existence 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of
		the Security Council—France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the UK and the US—and by a
		majority of the other 46 signatories.
		The first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented,and the Security Council
		took place in London beginning 6 January 1946. The General Assembly selected New York City as
		the site for the headquarters of the UN, and the facility was completed in 1952. Its site—like UN
		headquarters buildings in Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi—is designated as international territory.
		The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Trygve Lie, was elected as the first UN Secretary-General.

				Cold War era
			</b>
		</u>


		-Dag Hammarskjöld was a particularly active Secretary-General from 1953 until his death in 1961.
		Though the UN's primary mandate was peacekeeping, the division between the US and USSR often paralysed
		the organization, generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War.
		(A notable exception was a Security Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to
		repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea, passed in the absence of the USSR.) In 1947,
		the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition Palestine, approving the creation of the
		state of Israel. Two years later, Ralph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the
		resulting conflict. In 1956, the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez
		Crisis; however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of
		Hungary following that country's revolution.
		In 1960, the UN deployed United Nations Operation in the Congo (UNOC), the largest military force
		of its early decades, to bring order to the breakaway State of Katanga, restoring it to the control
		of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by 1964. While travelling to meet with rebel leader
		Moise Tshombe during the conflict, Dag Hammarskjöld, often named as one of the UN's most effective
		Secretaries-General, died in a plane crash; months later he was posthumously awarded the
		Nobel Peace Prize. In 1964, Hammarskjöld's successor, U Thant, deployed the UN Peacekeeping
		Force in Cyprus, which would become one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.

		With the spread of decolonization in the 1960s, the organization's membership saw an influx of
		newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa.
		On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but with the support of many Third World
		nations, the mainland, communist People's Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the
		Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as
		a sign of waning US influence in the organization. Third World nations organized into the Group
		of 77 coalition under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN.
		In 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed a resolution, over strenuous
		US and Israeli opposition, declaring Zionism to be racism; the resolution was repealed in 1991,
		shortly after the end of the Cold War.
		With an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle
		East, Vietnam, and Kashmir, the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary
		goals of economic development and cultural exchange. By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and
		economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.

				-Kofi Annan, Secretary-General from 1997 to 2006
			</b>
		</p>
		After the Cold War, the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties, taking on more missions
		in ten years than it had in the previous four decades.[37] Between 1988 and 2000, the number of
		adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more
		than tenfold.The UN negotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War, launched a successful
		peacekeeping mission in Namibia, and oversaw democratic elections in post-apartheid South Africa and
		post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia. In 1991, the UN authorized a US-led coalition that repulsed the Iraqi
		invasion of Kuwait.Brian Urquhart, Under-Secretary-General from 1971 to 1985, later described
		the hopes raised by these successes as a "false renaissance" for the organization, given the more
		troubled missions that followed.

		Though the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another,
		in the early 1990s the UN faced a number of simultaneous, serious crises within nations such as
		Somalia, Haiti, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia. The UN mission in Somalia was widely
		viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu, and
		the UN mission to Bosnia faced "worldwide ridicule" for its indecisive and confused mission in the
		face of ethnic cleansing.In 1994, the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in
		the Rwandan genocide amid indecision in the Security Council.

		Beginning in the last decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN condemned the
		organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption. In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan,
		withdrew his nation's funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
		Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by Britain and Singapore.
		Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the
		Secretariat, reducing the size of the organization somewhat. His successor, Kofi Annan
		(1997–2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to
		withhold its UN dues.

		In the late 1990s and 2000s, international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety
		of forms. The UN mission in the Sierra Leone Civil War of 1991–2002 was supplemented by British Royal
		Marines, and the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was overseen by NATO.In 2003, the United States
		invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting
		a new round of questioning of the organization's effectiveness. Under the eighth Secretary-General
		, Ban Ki-moon, the UN has intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the War in Darfur in Sudan
		and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons
		inspectors to the Syrian Civil War.In 2013, an internal review of UN actions in the final
		battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered
		"systemic failure". One hundred and one UN personnel died in the 2010 Haiti earthquake,
		the worst loss of life in the organization's history.

		The Millennium Summit was held in 2000 to discuss the UN's role in the 21st century. The three
		day meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history, and culminated in the adoption
		by all member states of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a commitment to achieve
		international development in areas such as poverty reduction, gender equality, and public health.
		Progress towards these goals, which were to be met by 2015, was ultimately uneven. The 2005 World
		Summit reaffirmed the UN's focus on promoting development, peacekeeping, human rights, and global
		security.The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in 2015 to succeed the Millennium
		Development Goals.

		In addition to addressing global challenges, the UN has sought to improve its accountability and
		democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency.
		In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between
		candidates for Secretary-General.On January 1, 2017, Portuguese diplomat António Guterres, who
		previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres
		has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for
		preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to
		be more responsive and versatile to global needs.

				Structure
		</u>
		</b>
		-Main article: United Nations System
		The UN system is based on five principal organs:
		<br>
		The General Assembly,
		<br>
		The Security Council,
		<br>
		The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC),
		<br>
		the Secretariat,
		<br>
		and the International Court of Justice.
		<br>
		A sixth principal organ, the Trusteeship Council, suspended operations in 1994, upon the
		independence of Palau, the last remaining UN trustee territory.
		<br>
		Four of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City.
		The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague, while other major agencies are based
		in the UN offices at Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi.
		Other UN institutions are located throughout the world.
		<br>
		The six official languages of the UN, used in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are Arabic,
		Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.
		On the basis of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the UN and its
		agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's
		impartiality with regard to the host and member countries.
		<br>
		Below the six organs sit, in the words of the author Linda Fasulo, "an amazing collection of entities
		and organizations, some of which are actually older than the UN itself and operate with almost
		complete independence from it".These include specialized agencies, research and training
		institutions, programmes and funds, and other UN entities.
		The UN obey the Noblemaire principle, which is binding on any organization that belongs to the UN
		system. This principle calls for salaries that will draw and keep citizens of countries where
		salaries are highest, and also calls for equal pay for work of equal value independent of the
		employee's nationality. Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered
		by the UN organizations.

		<hr>
		The Group of 77 at the UN is a loose coalition of developing nations, designed to promote its
		members' collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the UN.
		Seventy-seven nations founded the organization, but by November 2013 the organization had since
		expanded to 133 member countries.The group was founded 15 June 1964 by the "Joint Declaration
		of the Seventy-Seven Countries" issued at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
		(UNCTAD). The group held its first major meeting in Algiers in 1967, where it adopted the Charter
		of Algiers and established the basis for permanent institutional structures.
